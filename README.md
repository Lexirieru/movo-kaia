> Multichain architecture, optional per-second salary streaming, and flexible fiat/crypto withdrawals.

## Overview

**Movo** is a multi-chain cross-border **payment** platform that makes international transfers **faster**, **more transparent**, and **more secure**.

* **Single-role per wallet**: one wallet = one role. Employers register receiver wallets; once a receiver connects, the account is auto-recognizedâ€”**no invites or approvals** needed.
* **Current focus**: Indonesia with **IDRX** (Rupiah stablecoin).
* **Expansion**: Korea (KRW), the US (USD), and additional marketsâ€”prioritizing **Asia-focused stablecoins** first, then scaling globally.
* **Long-term**: a global payment hub that integrates multiple **payment rails** (e.g., XSGD, Peso tokens, EURS) and future **CBDCs** when available.

## How It Works

* **Roles**:

  * **Sender** (business/individual paying)
  * **Receiver** (earns/withdraws)
  * One wallet corresponds to **one role**.

* **Onboarding flow**:

  1. Employer registers receiverâ€™s wallet.
  2. Receiver connects that wallet â†’ account is automatically recognized (no invite/approval).
  3. Sender creates **escrow** (optionally enables **vesting/streaming**), funds it, and confirms.
  4. Receiver **claims** to crypto, or **(coming soon)** to fiat bank rails.

### Demo Lifecycle (Example)

* **Sender**: Create escrow â†’ choose token (e.g., USDT/IDRX) â†’ set receiver & amount â†’ (optionally preview vesting/streaming chart) â†’ create â†’ **top-up** if needed.
* **Receiver**: **Claim to crypto** now; **claim to fiat** is **coming soon**. Check **Profile** to verify receipt.
